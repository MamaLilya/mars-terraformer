# 🐱 Cat Colony: Mars Terraformation 🐱

A cat-themed Mars colonization platformer game built with Phaser 3. Help your feline astronauts collect resources, build a space station, and terraform the red planet!

## 🎮 Game Overview

- **Platformer Gameplay**: Jump between platforms, collect resources, and avoid lava
- **Resource Management**: Gather Catcrete (stone), Fish-Ice (ice), and Energy
- **Station Building**: Construct and manage your Mars colony with various buildings
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Levels get harder as you advance
- **Cat-Themed**: Everything is cat-themed, from the astronaut to the resources!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- A local web server (for development)

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project
2. Start a local web server in the project directory:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
   npx http-server
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## 🎯 Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move left/right
- **Space**: Jump (double-tap for double jump)
- **Mouse**: Navigate menus and build interface

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Configuration Management
- **`config/game-config.js`**: Centralized configuration for all game settings, constants, and shared data
- **Asset paths**: Organized by category (UI, resources, buildings, etc.)
- **Game constants**: Player physics, UI scaling, platform dimensions, etc.
- **Building definitions**: All buildable structures with costs, descriptions, and unlock conditions

### Asset Management
- **`utils/asset-loader.js`**: Centralized asset loading with scene-specific loading strategies
- **Automatic asset key generation**: Converts file paths to texture keys
- **Asset validation**: Checks for missing assets and provides fallbacks
- **Scene-specific loading**: Only loads assets needed for each scene

### UI Management
- **`utils/ui-manager.js`**: Reusable UI components and utilities
- **Resource displays**: Standardized resource counters with icons
- **Navigation buttons**: Interactive buttons with hover effects
- **Modal dialogs**: Reusable modal system for menus and confirmations
- **Progress bars**: Animated progress indicators
- **Animated text**: Text with optional animation effects

### Scene Architecture
Each scene follows a consistent pattern:
1. **Constructor**: Initialize scene properties
2. **preload()**: Load required assets using AssetLoader
3. **create()**: Setup scene elements, UI, and game logic
4. **update()**: Handle game loop updates
5. **Cleanup**: Proper resource management

## 🎨 Asset Guidelines

### Image Assets
- **Player sprites**: 256x256 pixels for animation frames
- **UI icons**: 64x64 pixels for interface elements
- **Resource orbs**: 256x256 pixels for collectibles
- **Building units**: 256x256 pixels for station buildings
- **Backgrounds**: Full resolution, will be scaled automatically

### Naming Conventions
- **Player**: `cat_colonist_*`
- **Resources**: `resource_*_orb`
- **Icons**: `icon_*`
- **Buildings**: `*_unit` for station buildings
- **UI**: Descriptive names like `build_menu_frame`

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use ES6+ features (const, let, arrow functions, classes)
- Follow JSDoc commenting for functions and classes
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Performance
- Load only necessary assets per scene
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Minimize DOM manipulation
- Use Phaser's built-in optimization features

### Error Handling
- Always check for asset existence before use
- Provide fallbacks for missing assets
- Use try-catch blocks for critical operations
- Log errors for debugging

### Memory Management
- Properly destroy objects when scenes change
- Clear event listeners and timers
- Use scene cleanup methods
- Monitor memory usage in development

## 🐛 Debugging

### Console Logging
The game includes comprehensive debug logging:
- Asset loading status
- Player state changes
- Resource collection events
- Platform generation
- Scene transitions

### Common Issues
1. **Assets not loading**: Check file paths and server configuration
2. **Player not visible**: Verify texture loading and scaling
3. **Physics issues**: Check collision group setup
4. **Performance problems**: Monitor asset sizes and loading
