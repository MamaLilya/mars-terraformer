# 🏗️ Build Logic Analysis & Fixes

## 📋 **Summary of Issues Found**

### ✅ **What's Working Correctly**

1. **Resource Spending Logic**
   - `UTILS.spendResources()` properly deducts resources when buildings are placed
   - `UTILS.canAfford()` correctly validates resource availability
   - Resource displays update after building placement
   - Insufficient resources messages are shown when needed

2. **Resource Balance**
   - **Solar Panel**: 0 energy cost, generates -2 energy (good balance)
   - **Rover Bay**: 15 energy cost, 1 upkeep (reasonable)
   - **Station Hub**: 20 energy cost, 2 upkeep (balanced)
   - **Living Quarters**: 5 energy cost, 2 upkeep (balanced)

### ❌ **Critical Issues Fixed**

#### 1. **Missing Mission Completion Logic**
**Problem**: Buildings requiring `missions_completed` would never unlock because this value was never incremented.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `window.SHARED.progress.missions_completed++` in `GameScene.completeLevel()`
- Now completing a Mars exploration level increments missions completed

#### 2. **No Rover Bay Requirement for Mars Exploration**
**Problem**: Players could explore Mars without building a rover bay first, breaking the intended progression.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added rover bay check in `WorldMap.js` and `Station.js`
- Mars exploration button shows "(Locked)" when no rover bay is built
- Shows explanatory message when trying to explore without rover bay

#### 3. **Building Tracking Issues**
**Problem**: Buildings weren't properly tracked in `window.SHARED.station.buildings` array.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `placeBuildingOnTile()` to properly add buildings to the tracking array
- Added duplicate prevention logic

#### 4. **JavaScript Runtime Errors**
**Problem**: Several JavaScript errors were preventing the game from running properly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Missing station object**: Added `station` object to `window.SHARED` initialization in `main.js`
- **Null cancelButton**: Added null checks for `this.cancelButton` in `Station.js`
- **Undefined station.buildings**: Added safety checks for `window.SHARED.station` and `window.SHARED.station.buildings` before accessing properties

## 🎯 **Current Building Progression**

### **Level 1 (Starting)**
- ✅ **Solar Panel**: Available immediately (0 energy cost, generates energy)
- ✅ **Rover Bay**: Available immediately (required for Mars exploration)

### **After First Mars Mission** (`missions_completed: 1`)
- ✅ **Station Hub**: Unlocks (100 stone, 50 ice, 20 energy)
- ✅ **Living Quarters**: Unlocks (20 stone, 5 energy)

### **After Second Mars Mission** (`missions_completed: 2`)
- ✅ **Water Module**: Unlocks (5 stone, 10 ice, 3 energy upkeep)

### **Terraforming-Based Unlocks**
- **Greenhouse**: Requires 20% terraforming (10 stone, 5 ice)
- **Research Lab**: Requires 40% terraforming (15 stone, 5 ice, 10 energy)

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Applied**

### 1. **GameScene.js**
```javascript
// Added mission completion tracking
window.SHARED.progress.missions_completed++;
```

### 2. **WorldMap.js**
```javascript
// Added rover bay requirement check with safety checks
const hasRoverBay = window.SHARED.station && window.SHARED.station.buildings && window.SHARED.station.buildings.includes('rover_bay');
// Shows locked state and explanatory message
```

### 3. **Station.js** (both versions)
```javascript
// Added proper building tracking with safety checks
if (window.SHARED.station && window.SHARED.station.buildings && !window.SHARED.station.buildings.includes(buildingKey)) {
    window.SHARED.station.buildings.push(buildingKey);
}

// Added null checks for cancelButton
if (this.cancelButton) {
    this.cancelButton.setVisible(true);
}
```

### 4. **main.js**
```javascript
// Added missing station object to SHARED initialization
window.SHARED = {
    // ... existing properties
    station: {
        baseUpkeep: 6,
        buildings: [],
        buildCapacity: 3
    },
    // ... rest of properties
};
```

### 5. **Resource Validation**
```javascript
// Added proper resource spending validation
const canAfford = Object.keys(building.cost).every(res => 
    window.SHARED.resources[res] >= (building.cost[res] || 0)
);
```

## 🎮 **Game Flow Now Works As Intended**

1. **Start**: Player can build Solar Panel and Rover Bay
2. **Build Rover Bay**: Required to unlock Mars exploration
3. **Explore Mars**: Complete level to get `missions_completed: 1`
4. **Build Station**: Station Hub and Living Quarters now unlock
5. **Continue Progression**: More buildings unlock with additional missions

## 📊 **Resource Balance Assessment**

| Building | Stone | Ice | Energy | Upkeep | Assessment |
|----------|-------|-----|--------|--------|------------|
| Solar Panel | 10 | 5 | 0 | -2 | ✅ Excellent (generates energy) |
| Rover Bay | 50 | 20 | 15 | 1 | ✅ Good (moderate cost) |
| Station Hub | 100 | 50 | 20 | 2 | ✅ Balanced |
| Living Quarters | 20 | 0 | 5 | 2 | ✅ Affordable |
| Water Module | 5 | 10 | 0 | 3 | ✅ Good balance |
| Greenhouse | 10 | 5 | 0 | 2 | ✅ Affordable |
| Research Lab | 15 | 5 | 10 | 5 | ✅ Higher cost for advanced building |

## 🚀 **Recommendations for Future Improvements**

1. **Visual Feedback**: Add visual indicators for locked buildings in the build menu
2. **Progression Hints**: Show tooltips explaining unlock requirements
3. **Resource Generation**: Implement passive resource generation from buildings
4. **Building Limits**: Consider adding limits on number of each building type
5. **Upkeep System**: Implement the upkeep system to consume energy over time

## ✅ **Status: All Critical Issues Fixed**

The build logic now properly enforces the intended progression:
- ✅ Resources are spent correctly
- ✅ Building restrictions work as designed
- ✅ Mars exploration requires rover bay
- ✅ Mission completion unlocks new buildings
- ✅ Resource balance is appropriate for game progression
- ✅ JavaScript runtime errors resolved
- ✅ All safety checks implemented to prevent future errors
